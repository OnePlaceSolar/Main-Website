                            include an agreement concluded electronically via email or written communications through a webbased portal.</p><br></br>

                        <p className="text-2xl mt-2"> OWNERSHIP OF DOCUMENTS </p>

                            ordinarily practiced under similar circumstances by engineering and design professionals providing
                            similar services. PROFESSIONAL shall exercise usual and customary professional care in its efforts to
                            comply with applicable codes, regulations, laws rules, ordinances, and such other requirements in
                            effect as of the date of execution of this Agreement. EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING, SERVICES

                            probable cost, but does not guarantee the accuracy of such estimates. Opinions of probable cost,
                            financial evaluations, feasibility studies, economic analyses of alternate solutions, and utilitarian
                            considerations of operations and maintenance costs prepared by PROFESSIONAL hereunder will be
                            made on the basis of PROFESSIONAL's experience and qualifications and will represent
                            PROFESSIONAL's reasonable judgment as an experienced and qualified design professional.
                            However, users of the probable cost opinions must recognize that PROFESSIONAL cannot guarantee
                            cost estimates and does not have control over the cost of labor, material, equipment, or services
                            furnished by others or over market conditions or contractors' methods of determining prices or
                            performing the work.</p><br></br>

                        <p className="text-2xl mt-2"> PRICING</p>

                            Proposal. PROFESSIONAL will bill direct nonpayroll expenses at cost plus 10%. Direct expenses
                            include all reasonable expenses resulting from required responses to subpoenas or court orders
                            related to the Services</p><br></br>

                        <p className="text-2xl mt-2"> SUSPENSION OF WORK</p>
                        <p className='mt-2'>The Client may, at any time, by written notice, suspend further work by
                            PROFESSIONAL. The Client shall remain liable for, and shall promptly pay PROFESSIONAL for all
                            Services rendered to the date of suspension of Services, plus suspension charges, which shall include
                            the cost of assembling documents, personnel and equipment, rescheduling or reassignment, and
                            commitments made to others on Client's behalf. PROFESSIONAL will submit monthly invoices to
                            Client forservices rendered and expenses incurred. If Client does not pay invoices within thirty (30)
                            days of submission of invoice, PROFESSIONAL may, upon written notice to the Client, suspend further
                            work until payments are brought current. The Client agrees to indemnify and hold PROFESSIONAL
                            harmless from any delay, claim or liability resulting from such suspension.</p><br></br>

                        <p className='mt-2'>Unless the accompanying Proposal provides otherwise, the proposed fees
                            constitute PROFESSIONAL's estimate to perform the Services required to complete the Project.
                            Required services often are not fully definable in the initial planning; accordingly, developments may
                            dictate a change in the scope of services to be performed. Where this occurs, changes in the
                            Agreement shall be negotiated and an equitable adjustment shall be made. Costs and schedule
                            commitments shall be subject to renegotiation for unreasonable delays caused by the Client's failure
                            to provide specified facilities, direction, or information, or if PROFESSIONALs failure to perform is due
                            to any act of God, labor trouble, fire, inclement weather, act of governmental authority, failure of
                            transportation, accident, power failure, or interruption or any other cause beyond the reasonable
                            control of PROFESSIONAL. Temporary work stoppage caused by any of the above may result in
                            additional cost beyond that outlined in the accompanying Proposal.</p><br></br>
