                        comply with your request unless We have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing
                        which override your rights and freedoms, or where the processing is in connection with the
                        establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. We will always comply with your
                        objection to processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes.</p><br></br>

                        <p className="mt-2">You will not be subject to decisions with a legal or similarly significant effect (including
                        profiling) that are based solely on the automated processing of your Personal Information,
                        unless you have given Us your explicit consent or where they are necessary for the
                        performance of a contract with Us.</p><br></br>

                        <p className="mt-2 text-2xl">Right to Withdraw Consent</p>

                        In order to exercise your rights in this section We may ask you for certain identifying

                        the above rights, please email Us at info@oneplacesolar.com. We will respond to your

                        <p className="mt-2">Usually, We will not charge you any fees in connection with the exercise of your rights. If
                        your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, for example, because of its repetitive
                        character, We may charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of
                        dealing with your request. If We refuse your request We will notify you of the relevant
                        reasons.</p><br></br>
